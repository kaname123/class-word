# class-word
//Create a class Word. Word has a constructor that takes a string argument
//and one method getSubstrings which returns a String containing
//all substring of word, sorted by length.

//For example, if the user provides the input "rum", the method returns a
//string that will print like this
//r
//u
//m
//ru
//um
//rum


//You can concatenate the substrings in a String, separating them with a newline
//("\n"). Then return the string
